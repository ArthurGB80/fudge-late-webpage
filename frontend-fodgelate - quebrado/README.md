1. Define the Data Model: Update the product.ts file in the products/model directory to define the data structure for your products. This might include properties like id, name, description, price, imageUrl, etc.
2. Create the Product List Component: Update the product-list.component.ts file in the products/components/product-list directory to fetch the list of products from the products service and display them. Update the product-list.component.html file to define the HTML structure for displaying the product list.
3. Create the Product Detail Component: Similar to the product list component, update the product-detail.component.ts and product-detail.component.html files to display the details of a single product.
4. Create the Product Search Component: This component could include a search bar for users to search for products. You'll need to update the product-search.component.ts and product-search.component.html files.
5. Create the Cart Component and Service: The cart component should display the products added to the cart. The cart service should manage adding and removing products from the cart.
6. Create the Checkout Component: This component should handle the checkout process. This might include collecting shipping and payment information from the user and submitting the order.
7. Create the Shared Components: The confirmation-dialog and error-dialog components can be used to display confirmation messages and error messages, respectively.
8. Update the Routing: Update the products-routing.module.ts file to define the routes for the product list, product details, and product search components. Update the app-routing.module.ts file to define the routes for the cart and checkout components.
9. Styling: Update the SCSS files for each component to style your application according to your brand's guidelines.
10. Testing: Write tests for your components, services, and other parts of your application to ensure everything works as expected.
